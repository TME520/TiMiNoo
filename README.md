## Presentation

TiMiNoo is an Open Source virtual pet for Arduino Leonardo R3. It's a game in which you take care of a cute cat: you feed it, clean it, train it and cuddle it.
The cat is different on each run, its characteritics are randomly picked at startup.

TiMiNoo has been created with busy people in mind: only one button, fast action, no sound. The gameplay is very simple and fluid on purpose, as this game is meant to be playable in an office environment with minimal disturbance.

TiMiNoo is about enjoying a simple yet feature-rich virtual cat, a companion for busy days.

Tamagotchi lovers could compare it to a Nano.
