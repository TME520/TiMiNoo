TiMiNoo ("Tee Me Noo") is a virtual cat providing minimal distraction, fully office-compatible, single button action, no sound, no death. The cat is different on each run, his characteristics are randomly picked at startup. It has been created with busy people in mind: The gameplay is simple enough for this game to be enjoyed in a work environment.

TiMiNoo is a feature-rich virtual cat, a companion for busy days: Cuddle, Feed, Educate, Wash and Entertain your very own furry companion. Tamagotchi lovers could compare it to a Nano.

# Features
## Single button gameplay
Wanting a gameplay as simple as can be, a single button solution seemed very appealing. Click once or click repeatedly depending on the action, that's it.
## No sound
I love having a virtual pet on my desk at work, but I also need to preserve my workflow from distractions. No beeping sounds is what I need.
## 2 mini games: Catsino Deluxe and Catwash Station
- *Catsino Deluxe*: Go to the casino with your TiMiNoo and do your best to win some yummy food to bring home. Beware of the ghost though!
- *Catwash Station*: When the fur of your TiMiNoo gets dirty, it's time for a proper toilet. Scrub scrub!
## 7 food items
Feed your TiMiNoo whenever he gets hungry. TiMiNoo doesn't die if you don't feed him, but he will give you that big eyes stare. Feed him a variety of food including:
